Scalability: Template approach allows rapid expansion to new cultural markets

Risk Considerations

Cultural Authenticity: Risk of misrepresenting traditional foods - mitigated by cultural expert review
AI Costs: OpenAI API scaling costs - mitigated by caching and optimization strategies
Market Validation: Uncertain demand for culturally-specific health solutions - addressed through MVP testing
Regulatory Compliance: Health claims and data privacy requirements - managed through legal review and disclaimers

Success Metrics

Implementation Notes
The project balances cultural sensitivity with technical scalability. The AI-driven approach allows for personalization at scale while maintaining authentic cultural representation through expert oversight and user feedback integration. The freemium model with low-cost entry product reduces barrier to adoption while building toward higher-value subscription revenue.
